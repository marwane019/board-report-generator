executive_summary:
  green_above_budget: >
    {company} delivered a strong performance in {period}, with revenue of {rev_actual}
    ({rev_variance_pct} ahead of budget). EBITDA of {ebitda_actual} represents a margin
    of {ebitda_margin_pct}, {ebitda_vs_budget} versus the {ebitda_budget} plan.
    The business continues to execute well across both its commercial and operational
    objectives, with the pipeline at {coverage_ratio}x quarterly coverage and ARR
    reaching {arr}.

  amber_slight_miss: >
    {company} recorded revenue of {rev_actual} in {period}, {rev_variance_abs} ({rev_variance_pct})
    below budget, reflecting softer-than-anticipated performance in {weak_revenue_line}.
    EBITDA of {ebitda_actual} delivered a {ebitda_margin_pct} margin, {ebitda_vs_budget}
    versus plan. The Board notes that pipeline coverage of {coverage_ratio}x and win rate
    of {win_rate_pct} remain areas requiring management focus in the near term.

  red_material_miss: >
    {company} experienced a challenging period in {period}, with revenue of {rev_actual}
    representing a {rev_variance_abs} shortfall against the {rev_budget} budget.
    Whilst EBITDA was {ebitda_actual}, immediate corrective action has been initiated
    across the commercial organisation. Management is implementing a structured recovery
    plan, details of which are set out in the Outlook section of this report.

financial_performance:
  revenue_narrative:
    above_budget: >
      Monthly revenue of {rev_actual} exceeded the {rev_budget} budget by {rev_variance_abs}
      ({rev_variance_pct}). On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew {yoy_growth_pct}
      versus the prior-year comparative of {rev_prior_year}. {saas_comment}
    on_budget: >
      Revenue of {rev_actual} was in line with the {rev_budget} budget (variance {rev_variance_abs},
      {rev_variance_pct}). Year-over-year growth of {yoy_growth_pct} reflects continued
      progress against the {annual_growth_target}% annual growth target.
    below_budget: >
      Revenue of {rev_actual} fell {rev_variance_abs} ({rev_variance_pct}) short of the
      {rev_budget} budget. The primary driver was {weak_revenue_line}, which underperformed
      by {line_variance_pct}. Management has identified the root cause as {root_cause_placeholder}
      and corrective measures are in progress.

  ebitda_narrative:
    healthy_margin: >
      EBITDA of {ebitda_actual} represents a {ebitda_margin_pct} margin, {margin_vs_budget_pp}pp
      {above_below} the {ebitda_budget_margin_pct} budget. Gross margin of {gross_margin_pct}
      reflects {gm_driver}. Operating expenditure of {opex_actual} was {opex_variance_pct}
      {above_below_opex} budget, with the variance primarily driven by {opex_driver}.
    compressed_margin: >
      EBITDA margin of {ebitda_margin_pct} is {margin_vs_budget_pp}pp below the
      {ebitda_budget_margin_pct} plan. Gross margin of {gross_margin_pct} has been
      impacted by {gm_pressure}. The Board notes that cost discipline remains a
      management priority; a full cost review is being undertaken.

  ytd_comment: >
    Year-to-date, revenue stands at {ytd_rev_actual} against a budget of {ytd_rev_budget}
    ({ytd_rev_variance_pct} variance). YTD EBITDA of {ytd_ebitda_actual} implies a
    run-rate margin of {ytd_ebitda_margin_pct}, {ytd_margin_vs_plan} the full-year plan.

commercial_performance:
  pipeline_narrative:
    strong_pipeline: >
      The total sales pipeline stands at {pipeline_total}, representing {coverage_ratio}x
      coverage of the quarterly revenue target — comfortably above the 3.0x minimum threshold.
      New pipeline generation over the last four weeks of {new_pipeline_4w} reflects healthy
      commercial momentum. Win rate of {win_rate_pct} is {win_rate_vs_budget_pp}pp
      {above_below} budget, with an average deal size of {avg_deal_size}.
    weak_pipeline: >
      Pipeline coverage of {coverage_ratio}x is below the 3.0x Green threshold, representing
      a deterioration from recent periods. Total pipeline of {pipeline_total} requires
      acceleration of new business generation to maintain revenue trajectory.
      The commercial team has been tasked with a targeted pipeline build programme
      with fortnightly reporting to ExCo.

customer_metrics:
  arr_narrative:
    growing_arr: >
      Annual Recurring Revenue reached {arr} at the end of {period}, an increase of
      {net_arr_movement} in the month driven by {new_arr} of new ARR partially offset
      by {churned_arr} of churn. Monthly churn of {churn_rate_pct} remains {churn_vs_budget}
      the {churn_budget_pct} budget. The NPS of {nps} reflects {nps_trend_comment}.
    declining_arr: >
      ARR of {arr} declined by {net_arr_movement_abs} in the month as churn of {churned_arr}
      exceeded new ARR additions of {new_arr}. The monthly churn rate of {churn_rate_pct}
      is elevated versus the {churn_budget_pct} budget and requires immediate Board attention.
      Customer Success leadership has been briefed and retention playbooks have been activated
      for all at-risk accounts.

operational_metrics:
  headcount_narrative:
    in_budget: >
      Total headcount of {total_hc} at period end was {hc_variance} {above_below} the
      {hc_budget} budget. The Engineering function represents the largest headcount at
      {eng_hc} FTEs. Monthly people costs of {monthly_cost} imply an annualised run rate
      of {annualised_cost}, against a full-year budget of {annual_cost_budget}.
      Cost per head of {cph} compares to a budget of {cph_budget}.

outlook_and_risks:
  standard: >
    Looking ahead, management remains focused on three strategic priorities:
    (i) accelerating pipeline build to restore {coverage_ratio}x+ quarterly coverage;
    (ii) delivering on the product roadmap commitments to support renewal rates;
    and (iii) maintaining cost discipline while continuing to invest in growth.
    The Board will receive an updated full-year reforecast at the next scheduled meeting.
